                    If you are a visual learner, you learn best from seeing the material laid out in front of you, or writing it yourself.
                    Visual learners are kept in focus by having things drawn out for them, charts, graphs, or physical notes themselves.
                    This allows them to eliminate distractions and view the concept with as little confusion as possible.

                <p>As a teacher of a visual learner, it is best to implement these practices:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Handouts, agendas, and outlines allow for your student to have a physical prop to refer to</li>
                    <li>Eliminate outside distractions, if applicable, close classroom doors, even windows, keep the focus on the materia</li>
                    <li>Pass out notes that include blank fill-ins so the learner must follow along</li>
                </ul>
