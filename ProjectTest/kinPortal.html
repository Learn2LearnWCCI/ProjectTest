                    If you are a kinesthetic learner, you learn best from touching and interaction.
                    Kinesthetic learners are kept in focus by having the ability to interface material
                    with movement. Examples include highlighting important mentions in handouts, taking
                    a break to stretch and regain focus, or playing music while working.

                <p>As a teacher of a kinesthetic learner, it is best to implement these practices:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>Provide highlighters, crayons, or colored pencils to students</li>
                    <li>Give tasks to occupy their time, while incorporating material learned</li>
                    <li>Give moments of down time to soak in all that has been learned and reset the mind</li>
                </ul>
